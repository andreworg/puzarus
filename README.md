# puzarus - computer aided Codeword puzzle solving

This program assists a user in solving a [Codeword puzzle](https://www.puzzler.com/puzzles-a-z/codeword).  
There is no computer aid other than allowing you to add/remove matches, in a very simple but quite efficient way.  
The user interface is terminal-based.

# Usage
This is still very much a proof of concept, and probably will stay so - read below.
Edit the puzzle in the code and run it.

# Why this was born

I once thought that Codeword puzzles, like other challenges that involve a trial and error process,
may be better enjoyed using a PC than on paper.

When I decided to give ChatGPT a spin, I needed a test case; I had recently solved a puzzle, so this came to my mind.

In case you're curious about this, most of the current code has not been generated by ChatGPT, but added or edited in some way by me.
The main goal of my test was to see at what point I would decide that fixing / adding things by myself
was more convenient (and/or less freaking boring) than talking ChatGPT into doing it.
When I thought that point had been reached, the program was still not very usable,
but in the end I decided to finish it up a bit.

# Why this is on Github

I am publishing this because I want to raise my Github skills, and I think there is no better way to do that than 
using a real project, so that I'll have a real use case scenario,
but I'll do it on a project that nobody will care about, so nobody will be pissed off if something gets broken.

# main TODOs

* design a format to define a puzzle - number matrix and known correspondence dict
* load / save puzzle
* ANSI color

# About the fancy name
The program has been completely rewritten from scratch after a first draft,
due to the accidental removal of the main file.
Thus the contraction bwetween the words "puzzle" and "Lazarus".
